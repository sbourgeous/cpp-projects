# C++ Task Manager

This project is a basic To-Do List Task Manager written in C++. This program allows users to create, view, complete, delete, and save tasks to a .txt file. This program uses classes, vectors, and files to manage different tasks and data. The goal was to demonstrate basic C++ implementation in a straightforward application. 

## Instructions for Build and Use

Steps to build and/or run the software:

1. Open a C++ development environment (I used VS Code).
2. Create a new C++ project or file and add the necessary libraries.
3. Compile and run your built program using your compiler.

Instructions for using the software:

1. Once the program is run, the Main Menu will be displayed.
2. From there, you can type in a number (1-6) corresponding to a specific option.
3. Follow on-screen prompts to manage your tasks, and then, if desired, save them to a text file (tasks.txt).

## Development Environment

To recreate the development environment, you need the following software and/or libraries with the specified versions:

* A C++ compiler
* C++ Libraries
    * iostrem
    * vector
    * string
    * fstream
* Any operating system

## Future Work

The following items I plan to fix, improve, and/or add to this project in the future:

* [ ] Have the ability to load tasks from tasks.txt
* [ ] Add priorities to different tasks
* [ ] Add the ability to edit a task
* [ ] Implement some form of GUI
